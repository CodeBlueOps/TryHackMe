Checking if a file exists is just the beginning‚ÄîYARA offers powerful conditions to refine malware detection.

Key YARA Rule Components
1Ô∏è‚É£ Meta (Optional but Useful)
Used for descriptive information (author, description, references).
Does not affect rule behavior.
Example:
rule example_rule {
    meta:
        author = "YourName"
        description = "Detects Hello World in files"
}
2Ô∏è‚É£ Strings (Pattern Matching)
Strings help find specific text or hexadecimal values inside files.
Example:
rule helloworld_checker {
    strings:
        $hello_world = "Hello World!"
}
But this rule is incomplete‚Äîit needs a condition!
Full version with a condition:
rule helloworld_checker {
    strings:
        $hello_world = "Hello World!"
    condition:
        $hello_world
}
‚úîÔ∏è This rule matches any file containing "Hello World!".
3Ô∏è‚É£ Matching Multiple Strings
Use any of them to match multiple variations:
rule helloworld_checker {
    strings:
        $hello_world = "Hello World!"
        $hello_world_lower = "hello world"
        $hello_world_upper = "HELLO WORLD"
    condition:
        any of them
}
‚úîÔ∏è This rule matches files containing:
"Hello World!"
"hello world"
"HELLO WORLD"
Using Conditions in YARA
Conditions allow complex matching based on various criteria.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Comparison Operators
Operator
Description
<=
Less than or equal to
>=
More than or equal to
!=
Not equal to
Example:
rule hello_count_checker {
    strings:
        $hello_world = "Hello World!"
    condition:
        #hello_world <= 10
}
‚úîÔ∏è Matches files where "Hello World!" appears 10 times or fewer.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Combining Conditions
YARA supports logical operators:
Operator
Function
and
Both conditions must be true
or
At least one condition must be true
not
The condition must NOT be true
Example:
rule hello_filesize_checker {
    strings:
        $hello_world = "Hello World!"
    condition:
        $hello_world and filesize < 10KB
}
‚úîÔ∏è Only matches if:
The file contains "Hello World!"
The file size is less than 10KB
Using YARA Effectively
üîπ Combine string matching with file size checks, counts, or other conditions for precise detection.
üîπ Use meta sections to document rules clearly.
